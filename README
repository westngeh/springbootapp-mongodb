README file for deploying a Spring Boot app with MongoDB in Kubernetes using a Kubernetes Deployment strategy:

Create a Docker image of your Spring Boot app:

Add a Dockerfile to your project root directory
In the Dockerfile, specify the base image, copy the project JAR file, and expose the necessary port(s)
Build the Docker image locally and test it
Push the Docker image to a container registry like Docker Hub or Google Container Registry
Provision a MongoDB instance in Kubernetes:

Create a Kubernetes deployment and service for the MongoDB instance
Use a stateful set to ensure persistence of data across pod restarts
Configure the MongoDB instance to use persistent volume claims to store data
Ensure that the service is exposed within the Kubernetes cluster
Create a Kubernetes deployment for your Spring Boot app:

Create a Kubernetes deployment that specifies the Docker image and environmental variables required for integration with the MongoDB instance
Use a Kubernetes secret to store sensitive data like passwords
Specify the necessary resource limits and requests for CPU and memory
Configure readiness and liveness probes to ensure that the pod is healthy and ready to serve traffic
Apply the Kubernetes manifest files:

Use kubectl to apply the Kubernetes manifest files for the MongoDB instance and Spring Boot app
Verify that the resources have been provisioned correctly and are running as expected
Test the connectivity between the Spring Boot app and MongoDB instance to ensure that the integration is working correctly
